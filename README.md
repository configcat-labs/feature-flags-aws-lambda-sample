# How to use feature flags with AWS Lambda

This is a companion repo for the blog article titled: **How to use feature flags with AWS Lambda**. The article walks you through the steps on how you can use ConfigCat feature flags to control functionalities of your AWS Lambda functions.

## Prerequisites

- [A verified AWS account](https://cloud.google.com/free)
- Basic [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and AWS knowledge

## Preparing the app

1. Clone this repo and run `npm install` to install the packages.

2. Open the `index.mjs` and replace `YOUR-CONFIGCAT-SDK-KEY` with your SDK Key. If you named your feature flag differently you may need to change its name in the `getValueAsync` function.

## Uploading and the code to AWS

1. In the root folder, run the following command to zip all the files:

```sh
zip function.zip *
```

2. On the function page, with the **Code** tab selected, upload your `function.zip` file by clicking the **Upload from** button on the right.

## Creating an API Gateway trigger

Add an API Gateway trigger. As a result, when a GET request is sent to the function endpoint it will trigger the execution of the function.

## Deploy the code

Click the **Deploy** button to publish the function, then make a GET request to the endpoint url generated by the API Gateway trigger.
